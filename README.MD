# Wormhole Potion Mod for Valheim

A Valheim mod that adds a potion to let the player teleport to their friends location on use. 

## About
The plugin adds a recipe to the cauldron which allows the player to make "potion of firth's bond." Upon drinking the potion the map will open and allow the user to click on a friend to be teleported to their location. At the moment you can not use the potion if you are carrying ores, but I plan to make that configurable in a future version.

### Recipe
The current recipe is: 10 yellow mushrooms, 3 Raspberry, and 1 Pike.

## Technical details
Built using [JÃ¶tunn](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/Jotunn) project stub.
